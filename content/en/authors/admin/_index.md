Hello, I am Hyeonwoo Lee, a student in the Department of Computer Engineering at Chonbuk National University. As I progress through the curriculum in my major, I am learning various programming languages and actively researching development cases to expand my knowledge.

My goal is to provide optimized, user-centric technology solutions. I am constantly exploring new tools and technologies, with a particular focus on using my skills in front-end development. I aspire to become a developer who designs innovative solutions.

Thank you.
